Total commander plugin for reading and writing Amiga disk dump files ADF (rw), ADZ (ro), DMS (ro), HDF (rw)

I have used mingw64 to compile the code. Therefore the source code is adopted for that environment. For makefile generator I have used premake. Premake is capable to generate Visual Studio solution too, but that is not tested.
